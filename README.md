# üåê Welcome to Simple Bank

> üí∏ A Simple Web3 application for managing Ether transfers and account balances.

## Description

This project is an intuitive web3 application created using JavaScript and Solidity. It leverages the power of Ethereum networks to provide a decentralized banking experience. With this dApp, users can deposit and withdraw Ether, transfer funds to other accounts, and check their balances. The application is built using Solidity smart contracts, the Ethers.js library, and the MetaMask wallet extension.

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the `Simple_Bank` smart contract in this project. [Learn more about Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).

- **Ethers.js**: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library that provides a concise and consistent API for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions in this project. [Explore Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

- **MetaMask**: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform transactions in this project. [Get MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

- **Hardhat**: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts. Hardhat is used to compile and deploy the `Simple_Bank` smart contract in this project. [Discover Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

### Follow these steps to get the project up and running üèóÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/simple-bank.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local blockchain using Hardhat:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat node
   ```
4. Open a new terminal and deploy the `Simple_Bank` contract:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configure MetaMask to use the Hardhat node ü¶ä

1. Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
2. Click on the account icon in the top right corner and select "Settings".
3. In the "Networks" tab, click on "Add Network".
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **Network Name**: Localhost
   - **RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
   - **Chain ID**: 31337
   - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
5. Click on "Save" to add the Hardhat network to MetaMask.

### Add accounts using private keys provided by Hardhat for testing üîë

1. In the MetaMask extension, click on the account icon in the top right corner.
2. Select "Import Account" or "Import Account using Private Key" (depending on your version of MetaMask).
3. In the "Private Key" field, enter one of the private keys provided by Hardhat.
   - To access the list of private keys, open the terminal where you started the Hardhat local network.
   - The private keys are displayed as part of the accounts generated by Hardhat.
4. Click on "Import" to import the account into MetaMask.
5. Repeat the above steps to add more accounts for testing purposes.

For more detailed instructions, refer to this step-by-step guide on [how to use MetaMask with a Hardhat node](https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408642503449-Using-MetaMask-with-a-Hardhat-node).

## Usage ü™ú

**To use the application, follow these instructions:**

1. After connecting MetaMask to the Hardhat local network, connect your wallet with the application.
2. Click on the desired action (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer) and enter the required details.
3. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
4. The transaction details will be logged to the console, and the account balance will be updated.

## Contract Details üîó

The `Simple_Bank` smart contract located in `contracts/Simple_Bank.sol` allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds. It emits events (`Deposit`, `Transfer`, `Withdrawal`) for these actions.
